Last year in Paris, something small changed how I think about marketing forever.

I were near the Eiffel Tower and asked ChatGPT for a coffee shop.  
It recommended a tiny café that had just opened.

We went there.  
The coffee was amazing.  
The owner was surprised we showed up — and shocked when he learned we found him through ChatGPT.

He literally said:

> “I guess I should invest in appearing there.”

That moment stuck with me.

Big brands weren’t showing up.  
Small, smart, early movers were.  
And AI was already shaping real-world demand.

That’s when I realized: **AI answers are becoming the new Google search results page.**

That’s why I’m building **Tropk**.

## **The shift: from Google rankings to AI answers**

For years, growth meant SEO.  
Ranking on Google meant traffic, brand, and revenue.

But discovery is changing fast.

People are asking:

- “What’s the best bank account in Brazil?”
- “Which AI tool should I use?”
- “What’s the best coffee near me?”

And instead of links, they get **a single synthesized answer.**

If AI doesn’t mention you, you don’t exist.  
If AI recommends your competitor, you lose.

This is a new distribution layer.  
And marketing teams don’t have dashboards for it.

## **The problem: companies are blind to AI visibility**

Today, companies track:

- SEO rankings
- Paid ads
- Web analytics
- Conversions

But they **don’t know how ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google AI describe their brand.**

Tropk measures:

- AI Visibility Score (how often AI mentions your brand)
- Share of Voice vs competitors
- Citations and sources shaping AI answers
- Queries where you appear (and where you don’t)
- Narrative risks and misinformation

And turns that into **growth actions**:  
what to publish, where, and how to win AI recommendations.

## **Why Brazil (and why now)**

In Brazil, most companies are still focused on SEO.  
Almost no one is thinking about **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)**.

That’s the opportunity.

AI search adoption is exploding.  
But the market is still wide open.  
Early movers will dominate AI recommendations — just like early SEO players dominated Google.

## **What Tropk is building**

Tropk is a growth platform for the AI search era.

We help companies:

- Monitor AI brand visibility
- Understand competitors in AI answers
- Optimize content for AI engines
- Align PR, SEO, and AI narratives
- Protect brand positioning in generative answers

In short:  
**We help brands win distribution in AI.**

## **Why I care**

I’ve spent years building AI products and integrations.  
The more I worked with LLMs, the clearer it became:

> AI is becoming the most powerful media channel ever created.  
> And brands have zero analytics for it.

Tropk is my bet on fixing that.

---

## **What’s next**

We’re launching Tropk gradually in Brazil, starting with AI visibility reports and early customers.

If you’re responsible for growth, SEO, marketing, or brand:  
**AI visibility will soon matter as much as Google rankings.**
