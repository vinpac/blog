Last year I was in Paris, and something small changed how I think about marketing forever.

I was near the Eiffel Tower and asked ChatGPT for a coffee shop.
It recommended a tiny café that had just opened. We went there. The coffee was amazing. The owner was surprised we showed up — and shocked when he learned we found him through ChatGPT. He literally said:

> “I guess I should invest in appearing there.”

Big brands weren’t showing up.
He was because ChatGPT was using this recent news page as a source.
Not the big ones, not the ones that in the first page of Google.

That’s when I realized: **AI answers are becoming the new Google search results page.**
And that's why I'm building **Tropk**.

For years, growth meant SEO.  
Ranking on Google meant traffic, brand, and revenue.

But discovery is changing fast.

People are asking:

- “What’s the best bank account in Brazil?”
- “Which AI tool should I use?”
- “What’s the best coffee near me?”

And instead of links, they get **a single synthesized answer.**

If AI doesn’t mention you, you don’t exist.  
If AI recommends your competitor, you lose.

This is a new distribution layer.  
And marketing teams don’t have dashboards for it.
