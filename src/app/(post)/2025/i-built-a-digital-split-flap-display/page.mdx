Since my visit to [Inhotim](https://www.google.com/search?q=inhotim+museum), I have been fascinated by split-flap displays. There's something captivating about their mechanical charm. I've always dreamed of building a real one, but life kept getting in the way.

This week, I decided to take the leap—well, digitally. I built a **digital split-flap display**.

## How It Works

I started with [v0](https://v0.dev/), a great tool that gave me a solid foundation:

However, the initial version had a few limitations: the sound played only once, and the animation wasn't quite what I envisioned. Determined to improve it, I downloaded the code and started tweaking.

### Adding Sound

After some research, I stumbled upon a [free-licensed split-flap sound effect](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/split-flap-display-58766/). It was perfect, but the raw file was seven seconds long, so I trimmed it and added it to the project. Here's the final sound:

<audio src="/sounds/split-flap-display.mp3" controls />

### Enhancing the Animation

Next, I dove into the animations. Admittedly, I had never worked with 3D CSS animations before, so it was a fun (and slightly daunting) challenge. After plenty of experimentation, I came up with the following CSS:

```css
@keyframes flip {
  0% {
    transform: rotateX(0deg) translateY(0);
  }
  100% {
    transform: rotateX(-180deg) translateY(-100%);
  }
}

.animate-flip {
  transition: transform 500ms;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  animation: flip 500ms 1;
}

.-transform-rotate-180 {
  transform: rotateX(-180deg);
}
```

This animation added the smooth, flipping effect I was after.

It was very fun building this \<3
