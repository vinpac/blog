### Why My First Startup Didn't Succeed — And What I Learned From It

Starting a startup was always a dream of mine. I had this burning curiosity to understand what it takes to build a business from the ground up. I often found myself waiting for the "right moment" — not that such a moment exists, but for me, it was about feeling ready. I wanted to know I had enough experience leading a team, building great products, and learning what works and what doesn't in the professional world. When I finally felt that confidence, I left a great job to launch my own company: **Utiliza AI**. 

Looking back, I realize I made several mistakes. And while these lessons came at a cost, they've shaped how I approach business and product-building today.

#### The Desire to Build Something Great

I started Utiliza AI with the idea of creating automation tools powered by AI. I loved building products — that was my strength. My goal was to create something innovative, and I poured my energy into crafting a platform that could simplify workflows. But I was so focused on the product that I overlooked a fundamental question: **Why would people use this? Who was it for? What problem did it solve?**

I became enamored with the process of building the tool itself and less concerned with understanding the users it was meant to serve. I didn't spend enough time asking critical questions like:  
- What's the real problem this solves?  
- Are there other ways people are solving this already?  
- Why aren't they using those alternatives?  

I was passionate about the product but not about the distribution, the problem itself, or the people who would use it. And that, I learned, was a critical misstep.

#### The Challenges of Focus

During those six months, I actually built three different solutions. Out of those, only one truly resonated with the small group of users I had. They loved it and even called me when it went offline — a sign I was solving a meaningful problem for them. But instead of doubling down on that success, I pivoted too quickly. 

I thought it wasn't enough and that I needed to create something bigger, something more. Looking back, I should have stayed the course, refined that solution, and explored how to reach more users who might have the same problem. But I was stuck on the idea of building a "successful startup," which led me to make decisions that were more about chasing scale than understanding and serving my users better.

#### The Lessons I Learned

1. **Passion for the Problem, Not the Product**  
   It's easy to fall in love with a product, especially when you're building it yourself. But the product is just a tool. What truly matters is the problem you're solving and the people you're solving it for.  

2. **Distribution Is as Important as Innovation**  
   A great product isn't enough. Understanding how to get it into the hands of the right people is equally, if not more, important. I learned that you can have the best solution in the world, but without the right distribution strategy, it will struggle to make an impact.

3. **Focus on What Works**  
   When users start loving your solution, focus on that. Lean into what's already working instead of trying to reinvent the wheel or pivot too quickly. Sometimes, what feels small is actually the foundation of something much bigger.

4. **Building a Business Is Hard**  
   Creating a good product is one thing; building a business around it is an entirely different challenge. It requires not just technical skills but also market understanding, distribution strategies, and a lot of resilience.

#### The Takeaway

The journey of founding Utiliza AI taught me that creating a business isn't easy — but I needed to try to discover that for myself. Despite the challenges and mistakes, I don't regret taking the leap. It gave me invaluable insights into what it takes to not only build something meaningful but also turn it into a sustainable business.

Today, I approach projects with much more humility and clarity. I ask better questions, listen more to users, and focus on solving real problems rather than just building cool products. Failure wasn't the end of the road — it was just the beginning of a deeper understanding of what it takes to succeed.
