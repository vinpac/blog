};

Starting a startup was always a dream of mine. I had this burning curiosity to understand what it takes to build a business from the ground up. I often found myself waiting for the "right moment" — not that such a moment exists, but for me, it was about feeling ready. I wanted to know I had enough experience leading a team, building great products, and learning what works and what doesn't in the professional world. When I finally felt that confidence, I left a great job to launch my own company: **Utiliza AI**. 

Looking back, I realize I made several mistakes. And while these lessons came at a cost, they've shaped how I approach business and product-building today.

## The Desire to Build Something Great

I started Utiliza AI with the idea of creating automation tools powered by AI. I loved building products — that was my strength. My goal was to create something innovative, and I poured my energy into crafting a platform that could simplify workflows. But I was so focused on the product that I overlooked a fundamental question: **Why would people use this? Who was it for? What problem did it solve?**

I became enamored with the process of building the tool itself and less concerned with understanding the users it was meant to serve. I didn't spend enough time asking critical questions like:  
- What's the real problem this solves?  
- Are there other ways people are solving this already?  
- Why aren't they using those alternatives?  

I was passionate about the product but not about the distribution, the problem itself, or the people who would use it. And that, I learned, was a critical misstep.

## The Challenges of Focus

During those six months, I actually built three different solutions. Out of those, only one truly resonated with the small group of users I had. They loved it and even called me when it went offline — a sign I was solving a meaningful problem for them. But instead of doubling down on that success, I pivoted too quickly. 

I thought it wasn't enough and that I needed to create something bigger, something more. Looking back, I should have stayed the course, refined that solution, and explored how to reach more users who might have the same problem. But I was stuck on the idea of building a "successful startup," which led me to make decisions that were more about chasing scale than understanding and serving my users better.

## The Lessons I Learned

1. **Passion for the Problem, Not the Product**  
   It's easy to fall in love with a product, especially when you're building it yourself. But the product is just a tool. What truly matters is the problem you're solving and the people you're solving it for.  

2. **Distribution Is as Important as Innovation**  
   A great product isn't enough. Understanding how to get it into the hands of the right people is equally, if not more, important. I learned that you can have the best solution in the world, but without the right distribution strategy, it will struggle to make an impact.

3. **Focus on What Works**  
   When users start loving your solution, focus on that. Lean into what's already working instead of trying to reinvent the wheel or pivot too quickly.

4. **Building a Business Is Hard**  
   Creating a good product is one thing; building a business around it is an entirely different challenge. It requires not just technical skills but also market understanding, distribution strategies, and a lot of resilience.

## The Takeaway

The journey of founding Utiliza AI taught me that creating a business isn't easy — but I needed to try to discover that for myself. Despite the challenges and mistakes, I don't regret taking the leap. It gave me invaluable insights into what it takes to not only build something meaningful but also turn it into a sustainable business.

Today, I approach projects with much more humility and clarity. I ask better questions, listen more to users, and focus on solving real problems rather than just building cool products. Failure wasn't the end of the road — it was just the beginning of a deeper understanding of what it takes to succeed.
