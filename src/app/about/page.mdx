I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur, currently the CEO of Utiliza AI. Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, I've built my career by combining a passion for innovation with a commitment to solving meaningful problems using technology.

I started learning programming on my own as a teenager [because of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc). At 18, I moved to São Paulo, and by 20, I became a director at Atados. I helped turn it from a volunteering website into a SaaS platform with over 50 clients. During the pandemic, I quickly created a donation platform for Atados, raising over 300,000 BRL to support community projects.

Over the years, I've honed expertise in React, Node.js, and AI technologies, leading projects such as Perch Insights, where I introduced early LLM solutions to revolutionize data analysis. These experiences culminated in founding Utiliza AI, a SaaS platform that automates workflows and meeting-driven sales processes, helping businesses optimize their productivity.

My focus remains on crafting tools that enhance user experiences while fostering scalable, secure, and innovative technologies.
